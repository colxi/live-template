- Binding process: NORMALIZE EXPRESZION before regiater it, removing hitespaces.nThis will prevent situations like
{{ myApp.test(a,b) }}
and
{{ myApp.test(a, b)}}
to register two diferent expressions

- Binding process:  replace unitializedIdemtifiers, with uninitialized Expressions.mThis will prevent unnecessary and redundant calls to Dom updates, in cases like
{{ myApp.test( myApp.name, myApp.ecomdName ) }}
where DOM UPDATES would be triggered twice, one for each idemtifier (even if the idemtifiers are part of the same expression).
+ myApp.name
+ myApp.ecomdName

- Keep track of all  keys of the identifiers keypaths, to trigger updates when a member of a binded keypath is modified
eg:
myApp.myItems[4]=undefined
would not update:
<span>{{myApp.myItems[4].name }}</span>
